## Features

- Compute GCD of two integers.
- Count even and odd digits in an integer.
- Reverse display of a string.
- Count occurrences of a character in a string.
- Calculate product of digits in an integer.
- Find the smallest element in an array.
- Calculate the sum of elements in an array.

## Usage
